## Color Coding

The system uses color coding for quick recognition:

- 🔵 **Blue Border** = Police call
- 🟢 **Green Border** = Ambulance call  
- 🔴 **Red Border** = Fire & Rescue call

---

## Tips for Efficiency

1. **Create CAD First** - For deployable incidents, create the CAD immediately
2. **Copy CAD Reference** - Add it to the call record for tracking
3. **Use Dropdowns** - Faster than typing, ensures consistency
4. **Fill While Talking** - Type as caller speaks (when safe to do so)
5. **Save Frequently** - Don't lose information if call disconnects

## Integration with CAD System

The call taking form works seamlessly with the main CAD system:

1. Take emergency call using form
2. Create CAD from information gathered
3. Link CAD reference back to call record
4. Both records now connected for audit trail

This creates complete documentation from initial call to incident resolution.
